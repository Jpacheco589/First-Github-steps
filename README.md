# UNAB TEACHER AUTOGRADE CODE
This code uses artificial vision and keyboard control throug python to grade automatically the teacher section. To use it, remember to have the COSMOS website opened in the teacher selection screen and to set it as your next ALT-TAB opening window. 

It is recommended to have a stable internet connection. This code doesn't have a security "Interruption" activation system, so in case of failing the selection of a teacher, the code may start pressing random buttons that would cause several problems in the grade page.
